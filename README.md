# Costing App (pre-release)
An application where you can create custom ratesheets for raw material & CMT processes to create custom components (eg. collar, pocket, etc.). You can then use these custom components, apply designs, and create an image of a garment with a live cost estimate by the side.

You can drag around the components for exact placement and at the end get the cost estimates in the form of a BOM sheet.

## Release
The pre-release of the app has been put out but it is still has several bugs in it. A publicly available version will be put out as soon as those bugs are fixed.
